## Challenge Information
These warmups are just too easy! This one definitely starts that way, at least!
<br/><br />

- DEFINITELY NOT EASY UNTIL I LOOKED CAREFULLY
- the file is mostly gibberish, so I tried checking the file type and even looked for strings in the file
- one of the strings was JFIF, meaning this is an image.
- changed file type and opened the file, nothing worked
- checked the metadata using exiftool, nothing
- found a link, where the file header was shown
- went back and saw that the file header was incomplete, probably why the file wasn't opening
- fixed it in a hex editor, opened the image and got the flag!
