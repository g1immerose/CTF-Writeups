## Challenge Information
These warmups are just too easy! This one definitely starts that way, at least!

## Solution

The challenge included a file with no file type. Now usually my thought process goes to thinking that this may be an executable, and I immediately look for strings in the file.

However, this wasn't a binary file, as one of the strings was JFIF. So its an image file! Changing the extension and opening the image should work, EZ! Or so I thought...


No image? Something's up.

Checked the metadata, no information. Checked the hexdump, nothing that caught my eye.

A bit of googling later, I came across a writeup for a similar challenge. After reading that, I went back and looked at the hexdump again, to realize that the file header was corrupted.

The solution? Fix the file header by editing it in a hex editor. I used hexedit in the command line for this challenge.

Now I checked the file type again, and ITS FIXED!

Open the image, and it is the flag of the challenge!
