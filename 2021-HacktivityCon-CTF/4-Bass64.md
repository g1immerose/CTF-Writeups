## Challenge Information
Woah! It's a natural disaster! But something doesn't seem so natural about this big wave...
<br/><br />

- very annoying challenge
- opened the text file attached with it and saw absolute gibberish at first
- then after sometime, realized word wrap was off
- after selecting that option, things finally made sense. it was base64 code
- typed it out and pasted to a base64 decoder, didn't work
- turns out I couldn't really get what the last few digits where, and also distinguishing between 0 and O
- so fixing that took some while, but I finally got it :)
