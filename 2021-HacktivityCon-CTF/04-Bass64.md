The challenge included a text file, which at first looked like absolute gibberish. After being stuck at this stage for quite a bit, I realized word wrap may have been on. Once that option was unchecked, things made a lot more sense!

Seeing the `=` in the end, this is definitiely base64 encoded text. So all that was left to do was figure out the letters and decode the text. This took a little while, as some digits were a bit tough to figure out.
