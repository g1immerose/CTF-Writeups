## Challenge Information
Woah! It's a natural disaster! But something doesn't seem so natural about this big wave...
<br/><br />

- this one took a while, as when I initially downloaded the file, I couldn't hear any audio (trust me my earphones weren't muted)
- so I was under the impression that I wasn't supposed to hear anything lol
- Looking up ways to extract information from audio, I was reminded about the Spectrum Analyzer.
- tried the online version, couldn't make any sense of the waveforms
- so I downloaded Sonic Visualizer, did some steps and saw the flag!

Flag: `flag{f8fbb2c761821d3af23858f721cc140b}`
