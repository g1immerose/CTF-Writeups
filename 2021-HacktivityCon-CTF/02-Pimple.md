## Challenge Information
"This challenge is simple, it's just a pimple!"
<br/><br />

## Solution
A file called pimple was included with the description. As it didn't have a file extension, the first thing was to check the file type:

```bash
piyagehi@Piyas-MacBook-Pro:~$ file pimple
pimple: GIMP XCF image data, version 011, 1024 x 1024, RGB Color
```

I added the file extension .xcf and opened the file in GIMP

Multiple layers are visible, so I started hiding each one till one image showed the flag

Flag: `flag{9a64bc4a390cb0ce31452820ee562c3f}`
