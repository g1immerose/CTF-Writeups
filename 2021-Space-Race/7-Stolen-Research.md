## Challenge Information
A malicious actor has broken into our research centre and has stolen some important information. Help us investigate their confiscated laptop memory dump! Note: if you need to crack passwords during this challenge, all potential passwords apear in rockyou-75.txt. Note 2: the pcap is only relevant for the last subtask. Note 2: do NOT attempt to brute-force rockyou-75.txt against the flag submission - it will get your IP banned.

## Sub-Challenges

### [100 points] Kernel release
What sort of OS and kernel is the actor using? Give us the kernel release version (the output of the 'uname -r' command).

### Solution

Hope you made a good custom profile in the meantime... The attacker is using some tooling for reconaissance purposes. Give us the parent process ID, process ID, and tool name (not the process name) in the following format: PPID_PID_NAME
